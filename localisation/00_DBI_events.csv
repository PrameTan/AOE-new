EVTNAME190401;The Mycenaean Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190401;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has requested excavation rights to look for the ruins of Mycenaean Greece. While we ourselves do not have the know how or money to fund a serious excavation of the area, and allowing a foreign contractor might be good for that reason, it might also be best to let the secrets of Egyptian history lie undisturbed until such a time when we ourselves can find them. Turning down a foreign power will spoil our relations and reduce their prestige, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA190401;Go for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB190401;This is a violation of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19041;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Grants Excavation Permit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190411;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has granted us the right to excavate and investigate ancient ruins in Myceanean Greece. The potential discoveries there will prove an enormous opportunity for us to increase our scientific renown in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;
EVTNAME19042;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Excavation Permit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC190421;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to allow us excavation rights in Myceanean Greece. Our international prestige has been lowered as a result, and relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have soured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mug_desc;"With the support of the Islamic orthodoxy, a younger son of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707), seized the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more and became the world's most powerful economy. Aurangzeb fully established sharia by compiling the Fatwa Alamgiri. He expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, ""many parts of the empire were in open revolt"". Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society, while other historians question this, noting that he built Hindu temples, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims, and married Hindu Rajput princess Nawab Bai. Whithout him we cannot effectivly govern our empire anymore without resorting to granting more autonomy to diffrent states.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
