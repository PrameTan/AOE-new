mug_desc;"With the support of the Islamic orthodoxy, a younger son of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707), seized the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more and became the world's most powerful economy. Aurangzeb fully established Sharia by compiling the Fatwa Alamgiri. He expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, ""many parts of the empire were in open revolt"". Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society, while other historians question this, noting that he built Hindu temples, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims, and married Hindu Rajput princess Nawab Bai.

EVT177502DESC;In spite of the recent losses in our last war, the parliament has made decision to enact a new tariff on our American colonies, so we may safely recover from our economic downfall. The principal objective was to reduce the massive amount of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the financially struggling company survive. A related objective was to undercut the price of illegal tea, smuggled into Britain's North American colonies. This was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament's right of taxation. Smuggled tea was a large issue for Britain and the East India company, since approximately 86% of all the tea in America at the time was smuggled Dutch tea. The Act granted the Company the right to directly ship its tea to North America and the right to the duty-free export of tea from Britain, although the tax imposed by the Townshend Acts and collected in the colonies remained in force. It received the royal assent on May 10, 1773.;x;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC170000;Peter's visits to the West impressed upon him the notion that European customs were in several respects superior to Russian traditions. He commanded all of his courtiers and officials to wear European clothing and cut off their long beards, causing his Boyard, who were very fond of their beards, great upset. Boyars who sought to retain their beards were required to pay an annual beard tax of one hundred rubles. Peter also sought to end arranged marriages, which were the norm among the Russian nobility, because he thought such a practice was barbaric and led to domestic violence, since the partners usually resented each other.In 1699 Peter changed the date of the celebration of the new year from 1 September to 1 January. Traditionally, the years were reckoned from the purported creation of the World, but after Peter's reforms, they were to be counted from the birth of Christ. Thus, in the year 7207 of the old Russian calendar, Peter proclaimed that the Julian Calendar was in effect and the year was 1700.;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700001;"In the winter of 1723, Peter, whose overall health was never robust, began having problems with his urinary tract and bladder. In the summer of 1724 a team of doctors performed surgery releasing upwards of four pounds of blocked urine. Peter remained bedridden until late autumn. In the first week of October, restless and certain he was cured, Peter began a lengthy inspection tour of various projects. According to legend, in November, at Lakhta along the Finnish Gulf to inspect some ironworks, Peter saw a group of soldiers drowning near shore and, wading out into near-waist deep water, came to their rescue. This icy water rescue is said to have exacerbated Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Staehlin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that no one else would have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link. In early January 1725, Peter was struck once again with uremia. Legend has it that before lapsing into unconsciousness Peter asked for a paper and pen and scrawled an unfinished note that read: ""Leave all to ..."" and then, exhausted by the effort, asked for his daughter Anna to be summoned. Peter died between four and five in the morning 8 February 1725.";x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700002;"Peter was born in Kiel, in the duchy of Holstein-Gottorp. His parents were Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (a nephew of Charles XII of Sweden), and Anna Petrovna (a daughter of Emperor Peter I and Empress Catherine I of Russia). His mother died shortly after his birth. In 1739, Peter's father died, and he became Duke of Holstein-Gottorp as Charles Peter Ulrich at the age of 11.Empress Elizabeth arranged for Peter to marry his 2nd cousin, Sophia Augusta Frederica (later Catherine the Great), daughter of Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst and Princess Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. The young princess formally converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Ekaterina Alexeievna (i.e., Catherine). They married on 21 August 1745. The marriage was not a happy one but produced one son, the future Emperor Paul, and one daughter, Anna Petrovna (20 December 1757 – 19 March 1759). Catherine later claimed that Paul was not fathered by Peter: that, in fact, they had never consummated the marriage. During the sixteen years of their residence in Oranienbaum, Catherine took numerous lovers, while her husband did the same in the beginning. Nature had made him mean, the smallpox had made him hideous, and his degraded habits made him loathsome. And Peter had all the sentiments of the worst kind of small German prince of the time. He had the conviction that his prince status entitled him to disregard decency and the feelings of others. He planned brutal practical jokes, in which blows had always a share. His most manly taste did not rise above the kind of military interest which has been defined as ""corporal's mania,"" the passion for uniforms, pipeclay, buttons, the ""tricks of parade and the froth of discipline."" He detested the Russians, and surrounded himself with Holsteiners.";x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700003;Though Catherine's life and reign included remarkable personal successes, they ended in two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolph, visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement was supposed to be announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. The frustration affected Catherine's health. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson Alexander as her heir, superseding her difficult son Paul, but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball. On 16 November 1796, Catherine rose early in the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon settling down to work on papers; she told her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, that she had slept better than she had in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 she was found on the floor with her face purplish, her pulse weak, and her breathing shallow and laboured. The court physician diagnosed a stroke and despite attempts to revive her she fell into a coma. She was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45.;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700004;News have been recently brought to the palace of your majesty about the possibility of a coup being organized by the king's wife, Catherine. They say that for a few weeks now she's been securing trust and legitimacy in various ways. News comes now that she has even managed to secure the backing of the orthodox church. Your Majesty, what shall we do?;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700005;In July 1762, barely six months after becoming emperor, Peter lingered with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, while his wife was at a different palace nearby. On the night of 8 July (OS: 27 June 1762), Catherine the Great was given the news that one of her co-conspirators had been arrested by her estranged husband and that all they had been planning must take place at once. The next day, she left the palace and departed for the Ismailovsky regiment, where she delivered a speech asking the soldiers to protect her from her husband. Catherine then left with the regiment to go to the Semenovsky Barracks, where the clergy was waiting to ordain her as the sole occupant of the Russian throne. She had her husband arrested, and forced to sign a document of abdication, leaving no one to dispute her accession to the throne. On 17 July 1762—eight days after the coup that amazed the outside world and just six months after his accession to the throne—Peter III died at Ropsha, at the hands of Alexei Orlov (younger brother to Grigory Orlov, then a court favourite and a participant in the coup).;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1788000;The leaders of the Anjala conspiracy met in Liikkala to secretly open communications with Tsarina Catherine the Great. Major Johan Anders Jägerhorn delivered the Liikkala note dated August 8, 1788 to the empress. The letter note was signed by several officers, including Armfelt, Commander-in-Chief of the Savo forces and the king's closest confidant. The officers declared the war to be illegal, asked for the restoration of the Finnish borders according to the Treaty of Nystad of 1721, and for peace negotiations with representatives of the Finnish nation, which they understood as representatives for the eastern and northern half of Sweden, which during the 18th century had twice been harshly occupied by Russia, and whose population overwhelmingly were ethnic Finns.;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1788001;The leaders of the so-called Anjala conspiracy have declared your majesty's rule incompetent and they have seceded our country with the help of Russia. What should we do?;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC172100;The king is dead, whilst the nation reels in grief, a new episode in Swedish history is mounting. The Riksdag of the Estates is gaining massive influence, with its powers restored by order of the new queen, Her Majesty Queen Ulrika. What developments Sweden will experience under this new political atmosphere remains a mystery. If it will usher in an era of untold prosperity in representation of the common people, or if the aristocracy will turn the kingdom into a puppet to line their pockets with, is yet to be seen.;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721001;For decades the two factions have torn Sweden apart. The Age of “Liberty” has turned the Kingdom into a sordid melting pot of corruption and covetousness. After great, save futile, attempts from His Majesty Gustav III to dispel the political animosity of the court, he has come to the conclusion that to save Sweden from inevitable Russo-Prussian invasion, he has no other choice than to launch a revolution. On the 19th of august he finally paraded his officers through the palace, soon before declaring the new constitution he addressed them: “If you follow me, just like your ancestors followed Gustav Vasa and Gustavus Adolphus, then I will risk my life and blood for you and the salvation of the fatherland!";x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721002;To dare any possible assassins, the King went out into an open box facing the opera stage. And after roughly ten minutes he said “this would have been an opportunity to shoot. Come, let us go down. The ball seems to be merry and bright.” The King with Baron Hans Henrik von Essen by his right arm went around the theatre once and then into the foyer where they met Captain Carl Fredrik Pollet. The King, von Essen and Pollet continued through a corridor leading from the foyer towards the opera stage where the dancing took place. On the stage several masked men - some witnesses talked of 20 or 30 men - made it impossible for the king to proceed. Due to the crowd, Pollet receded behind the King, who bent backwards to talk to Pollet. Anckarström stood at the entrance to the corridor holding a knife in his left hand and carrying one pistol in his left inner pocket and another pistol in his right back pocket. Anckarström edged himself behind the King, took out the pistol from his left inner pocket and pulled the trigger. Because of the King turning backwards the shot went in at an angle from the third lumbar vertebrae towards the hip region. The King twitched and said “ai” without falling. Anckarström then lost courage, dropped the pistol and knife and shouted fire. People from the King’s lifeguard stood some meters away. When they reached the King, they heard him say “ai, je suis blesse”. (I am wounded.) The king was carried back to his quarters, and the exits of the Opera were sealed. Anckarström was arrested the following morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until informed that Horn and Ribbing had also been arrested and had confessed in full. The king had not been shot dead;" he was alive and continued to function as head of state. The coup was a failure in the short run. However, the wound became infected, and on 29 March, the king finally died with these last words: ""I feel sleepy, a few moments' rest would do me good""";x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME91241542;Mazepa rebellion;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91241542;As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards the Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. Mazepa's call to arms was further weakened by the Orthodox Clergy's allegiance to the Tsar;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91241542OPT1;So he is a traitor? After all!;x;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91241543;Those Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new Hetman, Ivan Skoropadsky, on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the Zaporizhian Sich, which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. The Sich Cossacks paid dearly for their support of Mazepa, as Peter The Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack;x;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC170771;Word comes from Bengal that the traitorous Subahdar Murshid Quli Khan has seceded from the empire and declared himself as the Nawab of Bengal from his capital at Murshidabad. Quli Khan, a Hindu by birth, already had many disagreements with the Alamgir's own grandson over governance of Bengal. Now after Aurangzeb's death the traitor has taken the opportunity to openly declare his act of treason. It appears that he is well supported by local moneylenders and by a strong army. It would thus require a long and costly war to bring him to justice or we could simple accept the grim reality that has haunted the empire since Aurangzeb's death.;x
EVTDESC170772;In a shocking murder of the virtues of loyalty and nobility, Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung, the governor of Karnatak has seceded from the Mughal empire and declared his own state in the Deccan. Zulfiqar Khan had once been the most dependable of generals in Emperor Aurgangzeb's decades spanning campaign in the Deccan. The emperor had showered him with titles like Amir-ul-Umara(Noble of nobles) and eventually made him the Subahdar. Now after the Alamgir's death he appears to have forgotten all this past and has committed this heinous act of treason. With the unstable situation in the north it would be wise to maintain peace with him or we could go to war to stamp out his rebellion. A campaign to put down his rebellion would be very difficult as we would be fighting his armies in the Deccan, his home ground. The decision must be made.;x
EVTDESC170773;Taking advantage of the chaos at Delhi after Emperor Aurangzeb's death, the Sikh clans of Punjab have rebelled. The Sikhs have faced religious persecution and political oppression for the last two centuries. A constant guerrilla war has ensued with their Gurus(Religious teachers) in the Punjab and it only intensified after Emperor Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns as the focus of the empire shifted away from Punjab. Now the Sikhs have captured all major forts and towns in the area and declared an independent Sikh state. This threatens to cut off contact between our possessions in Afghanistan with the rest of the empire. We could negotiate with the Sikhs or march our mighty armies to crush their insurrection. Both methods would require immediate action.;x
EVTDESC170774;The flag of rebellion has been raised in Ayodhya as the Subahdar of Ouduh has seceded from the Mughal empire. Ouduh had been one of the richest provinces of the empire since its earliest days. Now the rebellious ruler has kicked out the local Mughal garrison, brought the support of various treasonous chiefs and crowned himself as it's ruler. Additionally, important roads leading from Delhi to Bengal are now in danger of being closed off which could bring trade to a complete standstill. Quick steps should be taken whether we decide to ignore his rebellion in favour of more important theatres or march upon his lands to restore the authority of the Mughal throne on Ouduh once again.;x
EVTDESC170776;Grim news comes from Sindh. The Kalhoras have disregarded Mughal authority and declared independence. Sindh is an important center of maritime trade on the Arabian sea and Muslim pilgrims to Haj are an important source of commerce in the region. Kalhora rule of Sindh began in 1701 when Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro was invested with title of Khuda Yar Khan and was made governor of Upper Sindh sarkar by royal decree of the Mughals. Later, he was made governor of Siwi through imperial decree. Thenceforth, Mian Yar Muhammad became the imperial governor of the entire Sindh. Now however with the weakening of Mughal authority after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, the Kalhoras have become confident enough to declare open rebellion. We must make moves to crush their confidence by facing them in battle on the lands of West India and crush their rebellion. Alternatively we may just let go of the Subah and concentrate on other theatres. The choice must be made.;x
EVTDESC170775;If there is a contender for the second most powerful man in India at this moment, then it's undoubtedly the Nizam of Hyderabad. Unfortunately it appears that this strongman of the Deccan has gotten tired of bowing before Imperial authority. The Nizam of Hyderabad has declared his independence and now claims his rule over most of the Deccan. Our choices are simple. We could match our armies South, fight a tedious war and attempt to crush his rebellion or we could instead avoid bloodshed and come to terms with him.;x
EVTDESC170778;The recent spate of wars and civil wars have utterly destroyed the power of the Mughal empire in Hindustan. The green banner of the Mughals, once flying high all over the subcontinent now flutters lifelessly in Delhi and a few remaining areas around it. The empire is now a snakehole of court politics and dirty plots supported by foreign kings. It's gone. But out of the ashes of one empire, a second shall rise! Perhaps it's now our age of glory and by Shiva's grace, we Marathas shall claim it!;x
EVTDESC170777;The flowers have blossomed and the sun shines golden upon Hindavi Swarajya as Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj has returned from his imprisonment in Delhi to lead an independent Maratha nation. After Maharaj Sambhaji's capture and execution by the Mughals, his son Shahu had been imprisoned along with his mother at Delhi by Emperor Aurangzeb. Meanwhile Shahu's uncle and then his cousin had declared themselves as the ruler at Kolhapur while the Mughals swiftly defeated the Marathas and forced them to negotiate. His aunt Tarabai in particular had gone so far as to make peace with the Mughals to ensure the rule of her son Shivaji II. Now with Aurangzeb's death, influential Mughal courtiers have released Chhatrapati Shahu in hopes that he would be a useful ally. Having defeated Tarabai, the Chhatrapati now leads a powerful force of Marathas. With the Mughal collapse, the gates of India are now open for us. Perhaps the rich neighbouring state of Gujurath might be an opportunity for quick conquest if we are ready to face the Mughals as our men have done countless times before that is!;x
EVTDESC170779;It's our own incompetence and poor luck that has destroyed our once great Mughal empire after the Alamgir's death. Perhaps our warriors didn't fight hard, perhaps out men were not loyal or perhaps Allah is testing us. Whatever may be the reason, it's clear that while we remain the 'Mughal Empire', we are no longer a real empire. Our authority once extending across the entire subcontinent is now only effective in Delhi and the surrounding areas. All over Hindustan, new princes and states have risen and are calling our empire as their own, perhaps rightly so. Even the great Babur had lost Samarkhand and managed to keep his resolve to fight and create the Mughal Empire. Perhaps we may rise again just as he did, but for now we have clearly lost.;x
EVTDESC175001;Oh the Mughal Sooltans were great and big all right, but their era is gone Sir. With their collapse,  India is now open for the Company. Years of investments in schemes and factories on the coast of India have paid off. We have patiently adhered to the rules and regulations of Delhi, we have borne their insults and their conditions and we have tipped our hats in their presence....for a century. No more. Its time we use this opportunity to annex the exclaves of the Mughals. They won't mind of course......because they can't! The East India Company shall now be a force in its own right and soon, the sun shall never set upon the Union Jack. Hail Brittania!;x
EVTDESC1573000;With the recent passing of Augustus II of Saxony, the time has come to honor our country's tradition and gather all the nobility for the election of a new ruler which will lead us to greatness. There have been a few concerns about the involvement of our eastern neighbours in the election, but hopefully it's only rumours. There are 3 main candidates for the Polish-Lithuanian throne: \n- Stanislaw Leszczynski - the current duke of Lorraine and strongly supported by France \n- Friedrich August III of Saxony the son of our previous ruler, who is rumoured to have been getting support from Russia \n- Infante Manuel, the Count of Ourem relatively unknown in our country and among the nobility, however he has a strong support from Austria.\n-The candidates are all fair choices, let's see who receives the most votes...;x
EVTDESC1573001;The recent Election in Poland-Lithuania resulted in the loss of our Candidate! This is an unwelcome surprise, the Russians said our victory will be secured, and the saxon dynasty will continue to rule the lands along the Vistula river! Our only choice is to inform the Russians of this outrageous incident and have them help us secure our rightful throne!;x
EVTDESC1573002;A saxon envoy arrived today at our court, telling of the results of Polish-Lithuanian Royal Election, which had our preferred candidate lose! This may effectively destroy all the influence we had in the Polish court, which is unacceptable! We are ought to intervene immediately if we want Poland-Lithuania to never be a threat to Russia ever again!;x
EVTDESC1573002;After our loss in the succession war, the current king has decided to step down and go into exile. August Friedrich III of Saxony has today came to Krakow for his coronation. None of our nobles has spoken against him, the coronation was silent, just as the sejm ratifying his rule. With the Russian army now residing near our capital, we cannot decide for ourselves freely anymore. This is truly the beginning of a dark era for Poland-Lithuania one which, if prolonged, may wipe us out of the european maps for many centuries to come...;x
EVTDESC1573004;Sad new have arrived today, as our current ruler has passed away. As tragic as it may be we must keep moving forward and the time has come to once again honor the almost 200-year old tradition of royal election. There have been 3 candidates that emerged as leading figures to secure our throne; \n- Stanislaw August Poniatowski - Supported by Russia, a member of the Czartoryski Family and an intellectual. He is also rumored to had been having an affair with The Russian Tsar - Catharine Romanov. He may be in favor of continuing the Russian schemes in our court. \n- Jan Klemens Branicki is in charge of our southern Ruthenian provinces, he is known to be a conservative and isn't really widely known among the higher Polish nobility. \n- Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, the brother of Stansilaw, the first candidate. A proper member of the Familia party, which has been proposing many liberal reforms for the past years, which all were unfortunately vetoed by our conservative nobility. \n- it is critical we elect a worth candidate, as our very existence as a sovereign nation is at risk in this dark times;x
EVTDESC15730041;Recognizing that the destiny of us all depends solely upon the establishment and perfection of a national constitution, having by long experience learned the inveterate faults of our government, and desiring to take advantage of the season in which Europe finds itself and of this dying moment that has restored us to ourselves, free of the ignominious dictates of foreign coercion, holding dearer than life, than personal happiness the political existence, external independence and internal liberty of the people whose destiny is entrusted to our hands, and desiring to merit the blessing and gratitude of contemporary and future generations, despite obstacles that may cause passions in us, we do for the general welfare, for the establishment of liberty, for the preservation of our country and its borders, with the utmost constancy of spirit ordain this Constitution and declare it to be entirely sacred and inviolable until the people, at the time by law prescribed, by their clear will recognize a need to alter any of its articles. To which Constitution the further statutes of the present Sejm shall apply in everything. Or will it? should we ratify this document my King or is it too dangerous?;x
EVTDESC15730042;Not all nobles agree with our newly ratified constitution. A confederation was established by Polish and Lithuanian magnates, in Saint Petersburg, with the backing of the Russian Empress Catherine II. The confederation opposes our new government, which had been adopted by the Great Sejm, especially the provisions limiting the privileges of the nobility. The text of the founding act of the confederation was drafted by the Russian general Vasili Stepanovich Popov, Chief of Staff of Prince Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin. Its purpose was proclaimed in the small town of Targowica and the Potocki's estate (now near Novoarkhanhelsk in Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine).This may result in a full scale Russian intervention...;x

EVTDESC171107;Louis XIV (Louis Dieudonné; 5 September 1638 – 1 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (Louis le Grand) or the Sun King (le Roi Soleil), was King of France from 14 May 1643 until his death in 1715. His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country in European history. In the age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power. Louis began his personal rule of France in 1661, after the death of his chief minister, the Italian Cardinal Mazarin. An adherent of the concept of the divine right of kings, Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralised state governed from the capital. He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis' minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution.;x
EVTDESC171108;From 1647 to 1711, the three chief physicians to the king (Antoine Vallot, Antoine d'Aquin, and Guy-Crescent Fagon) recorded all of his health problems in the Journal de Santé du Roi (Journal of the King's Health), a daily report of his health. On 18 November 1686, Louis underwent a painful operation for an anal fistula that was performed by the surgeon Charles Felix de Tassy, who prepared a specially shaped curved scalpel for the occasion. The wound took more than two months to heal. Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday, after 72 years on the throne. Enduring much pain in his last days, he finally "yielded up his soul without any effort, like a candle going out", while reciting the psalm Domine, ad adjuvandum me festina (O Lord, make haste to help me).;x
EVTDESC171109;The past few years have not been kind to our poorest citizens and peasantry. The combination of our high taxes and the overall dissatisfaction with the regime among the populace has resulted in the general growing unrest among our people. If we don't do something about it, our plans for european expansion may be halted. This issue truly requires a drastic change in our ways of governing, but we know that only absolute power can guarantee the safety of our subjects!;x
EVTDESC171110;The King of France has announced his claims to the Northern Italian lands! This is outrageous! What's even worse we cannot stand alone against the French. An idea has been spreading around the members of our court to establish a confederacy between the Italian states free of the Bourbon influence. The other option of course is to ask the emperor for help, but our nobles see it as more of a "last resort".;x
EVTDESC171111;Tuscan diplomat has came to us with a proposition for a defensive confederacy against the french imperialists. This confederacy would in theory respect our freedoms and give us autonomy for the time of war with France as well as aim to diminish all French influence in the region.

EVTDESC174500;Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, probably out of mushroom poisoning. He had ignored the advice of Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 gulden, which were claimed by his widow. The army had also been weakened due to these wars; instead of the full number of 160,000, the army had been reduced to about 108,000, and they were scattered in small areas from the Austrian Netherlands to Transylvania, and from Silesia to Tuscany. They were also poorly trained and discipline was lacking. Later Maria Theresa even made a remark: "as for the state in which I found the army, I cannot begin to describe it." But this will all soon come to an end. As Maria Theresa Begins her reign, a new era approaches Austria, one of greatness and prosperity!;x
EVTDESC174501;It is unlikely that Maria Theresa ever completely recovered from the smallpox attack in 1767, as 18th-century writers asserted. She suffered from shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia and insomnia. She later developed edema. Maria Theresa fell ill on 24 November 1780. Her physician Dr. Störk thought her condition serious, although Joseph was confident that she would recover in no time. By 26 November, she asked for the last rites, and on 28 November, the doctor told her that the time had come. On 29 November, she died surrounded by her remaining children.;x

Truly a man with legitimacy in place of blood in his veins, as is required if one is to rule an empire stretching from Göteborg to Livonia to the top of the world.;x
EVTDESC174502;Since the death of Charles II of Spain, the Habsburg family and its realms developed a serious problem. Their male lines began to go extinct. First Charles II died without a heir and that resulted in the war of Spanish succession. In 1703 Charles VI, the prince of Austria signed a mutual pact with his elder brother Joseph I. One of its agreements was that in case they both failed to have a male heir, then Joseph's daughters would inherit all Habsburg pessesions after both of them had died. Joseph became Holy Roman emperor soon after, failed to have a male heir and died in 1711 after which Charles VI succeeded him. However Charles himself failed to produce a male heir and began to worry that upon his death, the Habsburg domains would slip away from his line to Joseph's daughters as decreed by the Mutual pact of 1703. To counter that, Charles has now declared a Pragmatic sanction law according to which his daughters would inherit the throne rather than his nieces. This has not been received well by many in the empire and abroad and may just prove to be the spark of future internal strife.;x

EVTDESC176800;Prince Kristian had always been a strange child, he had no blemish in his brilliant intellect nor his dazzling charisma, but his oddity lay deeper. He was beset by hallucinations, devastating personality swings, melancholy, and an emerging destruction mania. Unfortunately his redeeming qualities could never be fully realized, as his education was largely ignored, and the tutor that he did have was outright abusive. Many speculate that his mental state was inherited through blood, as his Cousin, George III of Great Britain, showed similar traits, known widely as the “Royal Malady”. Upon the death of Fredrik V, Kristian ascended to the throne, his chosen motto was: “Gloria ex amore patriae”, meaning, “glory through love of the fatherland”.;x
EVTDESC171009;It probably started in some backalley in Paris, then it spread to the neighbouring lanes and streets. Further it creeped its way to the surrounding countryside. Now the flame of revolution has spread to the whole of France and threatens to overturn our rule of the Dual monarchy.

From lowly peasants to conspiring armymen, many have joined the rebel army and a deadly war to shake the very foundations of our rule in France has begun.;x
EVTDESC171000;War after war has launched Britain’s debt into orbit. The debt is, in fact, so staggeringly large that nobody actually knows exactly how much we owe. Britain’s balance sheet shows a hastily written rough estimate of “9,000,000 Pounds” (This would only be fully repaid recently, in 2015, three centuries later). Bankruptcy now could very well mean our utter collapse.;x
EVTDESC171001;Facing up to 20 million pounds of debt, our ministry has been forced to take some desperate measures to keep our nation from outright collapsing. The chancellor of the exchequer (minister of debt) has joined together with a rather.. conniving.. Businessman. Together they have founded The South Sea Company to deal with government debt, a government puppeted trading company with monopoly in Latin America. However, these ports are all owned by Spain, and the recent Spanish war of succession has made British trading here nigh impossible. Instead, to make money, the company has launched a less than honourable scheme, involving all kinds of scamming, corruption, and general skullduggery. The company, without earning a single pound in actual profit, is beginning to make ever accelerating swathes of dishonest money. Money, however, that the government sorely needs...;x
